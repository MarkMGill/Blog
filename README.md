# Blog
Blog using React, Redux, and AJAX call to jsonPlaceholder API from a course. I added the 'love' button, counter, and comment functionality myself.

# Functionality
Blog displays from AJAX call to jsonPlaceholder API.  Click on the 'love' button and the counter appears and increments as many times as you click.  Click on comment button to display input box.  Write comment in box and click 'Submit' or press enter and comment displays in a div below the blog post.
